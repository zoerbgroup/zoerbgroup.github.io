The Zoerb group studies atmospheric chemistry with a focus on wildfire emissions and aerosol particle properties. We are interested in the chemical and physical processes influencing smoke plume composition, particle aging, and impacts on air quality. More recently, we have begun to examine the health impacts of aerosol samples from different sources through measurements of oxidative potential. Current projects involve air sampling, instrumental analysis, and air quality modeling. Students will have the opportunity to gain experience with a variety of instrumental techniques including spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, air sampling techniques, data analysis, and computational modeling of atmospheric properties. This work has implications ranging from basic chemistry to fields such as climate science and air quality.
